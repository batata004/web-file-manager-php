# web-file-manager-php
This is the simplest and most powerful file manager you can get to manage you server directories/files and even fully edit them (with a pretty nice code editor) using just your browser. Works fine with PHP 7.x and 8.x and nothing else.

This script allows copying/moving files/directories, compressing/extracting files/directories and even editing files online with code support to some languages like HTML, CSS and PHP.

To install this script on your server you just need to open the `index.php` file and set your desired values to the two variables at the top of the code. After that upload the `index.php` file to any directory in your server (no other file needs to be uploaded) and access it using your browser.
