# web-file-manager-php
This is the simplest and most powerful file manager you can get to browse you server directories/files and even fully edit them with a pretty nice code editor. Works fine with PHP 7.x and 8.x and nothing else.

This script allows copying/moving files/directories, compressing/extracting files/directories and even editing files online with code support to some languages like HTML, CSS and PHP.
